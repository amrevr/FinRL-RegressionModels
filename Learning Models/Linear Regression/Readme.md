# Linear Regression Model
Linear regression is using an independent variable to predict the dependent variable.

**Platforms Used**
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupiter Notebooks
- Python
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy
  - Sklearn

**February**
I went into this project not having any Python experience so I needed to spend time learning the code. Once I was able to gain understanding of the language I began to do research the different tools which I needed to use. I learned how to use Pandas to read data from the csv file. I also understood how to use Matplotlib to display a graph of that data.

**March**
I started researching how to create a linear regression model. I created methods to perform calculation to get the values of the coeffiecients needed to make the linear equation. Once I was able to get the outputs of the linear equation, I put all that data into an array and displayed a linear regression model reflective of the whole given data. I also calculated the R^2 value to understand how accurate the model was.

**April**
I started using certain parts of the data as training data that would be used to for calculating the coefficients of the linear equation. I would then use this equation to predict the next day and the cycle would repeat for the following days. I tested this model on multiple datasets and improved the model while also making sure that I am not overfitting. I also calculated the Mean Squared Error to use a different metric in measuring how accurate the model was.
