# Purpose of Model

After looking at our dataset as a time series graph, we can see that the stock exchange prices are non-linear. 
Therefore, we wanted to determine if training our model on a non-linear model would provide a more accurate prediction
of the stock exchange. 

# What is a Polynomial Regression Model

Polynomial regression is a form of linear regression, which models the relationship between dependent and independent 
variables as an nth-degree polynomial. For example, a model with a degree of 1 would be a linear mode, with a degree of 2
would be a polynomial model, a degree of 3 would be a cubic mode, etc. 

# Why Use This Model

1.) Polynomial Regression Models don't require a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.
2.) We see that our data seems to follow a curved pattern.
3.) If the Linear Regression Model either fails, or does not accurately capture the data points.
