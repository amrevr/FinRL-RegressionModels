#FinRL-RegressionModels - Bayessian Model
Bayesian regression is a statistical modeling technique that extends traditional regression analysis by incorporating Bayesian principles. 

**Tools Utilized**

- Visual Studio Code
- Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Swig
  - box2d
  - Ski-kit Learn
    
**February**

- Obtained and chose the data from Yfinance
  - Nasdaq, SNP500, Tesla, Diji
- Researched how to use csv, python, and pandas
- Used Pandas to store the data
- Used Matplotlib to graph and visualize the data we were working on

**March**

- Used Sklearns train_test_split to split the data for training and testing
- I used bayesian model from sklearn for fitting
- I used polynomial features to incorporate the curve of the stock prices
- Graphed and visualized using matplotlib to observe the predictions from the model
- Used Mean squared error and R^2 to measure the accuracy of the model

**April**

- Tested the model on multiple datasets to measure the accuracy of the model
- Used fine-tuning to improve performance on other sets
- Made visualizations for poster
